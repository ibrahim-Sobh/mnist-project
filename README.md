# mnist-project

This Project is about building a primitive ML Model using basic Linear Algebra concepts, Written in Java using Intellij IDE.
I used the MNIST digits Data set.

For this project to work properly you need to specify the file_Path_train & filePath_test with respectively
"mnist_train.csv" an "mnist_test.csv" files loctions on your local computer (Both in dataexploration/Launcher Class)
you can look for these 2 Data sets online can be found easily.
